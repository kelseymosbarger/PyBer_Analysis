# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

## Overview of PyBer
wokring for PyBer, I am using matplotlib to help present better data visualizations to the CEO. This challenge summarizes data and privides a final line graph (inaddtion to the many graphs created throught the module)

### Resources:
Python
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook
Matplotlib


## Results
PyBer sees the most volume of rides in urban environments, and higher average fares in rural environments. Volume fron the urban areas is a larger total fare mover than the "higher than average" rural clients.



## Summary
Based on the analysis performed, (1) it would be beneficial to increase the demand and amount of drivers in the suburban areas. (2) It would also be interesting to see the average ride distance in the suburban and rural areas - to know if increased drivers would drive more business or perhaps (3) a discount fare program/ loyalty program to incentivize more use and increase the volume.
